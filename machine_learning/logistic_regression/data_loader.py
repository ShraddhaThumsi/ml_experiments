# Files used for analysis - (Bank-wise ATM/POS/Card statistics - May,April,March 2022)
# (Unanswered) Questions about data:
# 1. If payments through online modals for credit card counts as e-commerce, what is the column "other" representing? does it represent fees to the merchant or any other third party?
# 2. How can we have more volume of "other" credit card swipes than the value incurred from it? unless we are able to charge a credit card half rupee in a transaction, this wouldn't make sense



"""Problem statement - You are given the credit card/debit transaction yield per bank for the months March, April and May 2022.
Over all the banks which is likely to yield higher value, credit card, or debit card?
(predict 1 for debit card and 0 for credit card)"""
